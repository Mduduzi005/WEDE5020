#Website Overview 

I have built a professional, multi-page website for a fictional IT support company based in Johannesburg. The site is designed to be informative and user-friendly, targeting students, home offices, and small businesses. 

1. Website Structure & Pages 

I created a 5-page website with a consistent navigation menu across all pages. 

Home: The landing page introducing the company. 

About: A detailed page about the company's story, team, and values. 

Services: A page showcasing the services offered with transparent pricing. 

Enquiry: A general contact form for questions. 

Contact: A page with contact details and a specific form to book a consultation. 

2. Key Features and Components You Implemented 

A. Consistent Layout & Navigation 

A fixed navigation bar at the top of every page with links to all five pages. 

A semantic HTML structure using <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>. 

A fixed footer on every page with a copyright notice. 

B. Home Page (home.html) 

Hero Section: A welcoming introduction with the company's mission and vision. 

"Why Choose Us" Section: A list of key selling points. 

Stats Section: A track record display with client numbers, years of experience, and satisfaction rate. 

Featured Services: A grid of cards previewing the main services, which link to the services page. 

Testimonial: A client quote to build trust. 

C. About Page (about.html) 

Company Story: The founding story and growth of the company. 

Mission & Vision: Clear statements of the company's goals. 

Core Values: A list of five values that define the company's approach. 

Target Audience: A list specifying who the company serves. 

Team Section: A major feature with a grid of team member cards, including: 

Photos for each team member (with placeholder image paths like Team/John.jpg). 

Names, roles, and descriptions for four team members. 

Achievements: A list of key stats and accomplishments. 

D. Services Page (services.html) 

Detailed Service Cards: This is a highlight of the site. You created an advanced card layout for four main services: 

IT Consulting 

Hardware Repairs 

Software Debugging 

Small Business Support 

Each card includes: 

A unique gradient color scheme. 

A clear pricing structure (hourly, package, or monthly). 

A list of what the service includes. 

A note with a typical price example. 

A call-to-action button linking to the contact page. 

Additional sections: "Additional Services," "How Our Service Works," testimonials, and an FAQ. 

E. Interactive Forms (enquiry.html & contact.html) 

Enquiry Form (enquiry.html): A comprehensive form for general questions with fields for name, email, phone, service interest, contact method, subject, and a message. 

Booking Form (contact.html): A simpler form specifically for booking a consultation, requesting name, email, phone, preferred date, service type, and details. 

Both forms are functional and use mailto: to send submissions via email. 

F. Styling and Design (style.css) 

I created an extensive and modern CSS stylesheet with the following features: 

Modern Aesthetic: Use of gradients, shadows, and rounded corners. 

Card-Based Layouts: Implemented a responsive grid system (.cards-container) used for both services and the team section. 

Hover Effects: Cards have a smooth "lift" effect on hover. 

Color-Coding: Each service type (Consulting, Hardware, etc.) has its own distinct gradient. 

Responsive Design: The site adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries. The navigation stack on mobile. 

Full-Page Background Image: You set a fixed, full-screen background image (images/Background tech image.jpg) with a dark overlay for readability. 

Logo Styling: Styled the company logo with rounded corners. 

Team Photos: Styled team member images as circular photos with a border. 

3. Technical Implementation Details 

Semantic HTML5: Proper use of elements like <article>, <section>, and <header>. 

CSS Grid & Flexbox: Used for creating responsive layouts (e.g., the services grid and navigation bar). 

Responsive Images: Team photos and the logo are set to be flexible (width: 100%; height: auto;). 

Accessibility Considerations: Added aria-label attributes to service cards and used semantic tags for better screen reader compatibility. 

Form Validation: Used HTML5 validation attributes like required on form fields. 

 4. Location Information 

I have consistently emphasized the company's location to appeal to local customers in Johannesburg.
